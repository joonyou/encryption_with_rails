Encryption Fun Between Cocoa and Rails
======================================

These are example code from RubyHead screencast where I show how to encrypt on iOS or Mac app decrypt at server using Rails.  The goal is to demonstrate how simple it is to send protected data without using SSL.  It also shows some caveats when using Rails as a server.

All the code you need are here and should be straight forward.  The categories for NSData are [https://github.com/joonyou/cocoaes](https://github.com/joonyou/cocoaes).  The credit for this goes to others.  I added IV to encrypt method, that's all.

The screencast is available [here - I forgot to record](#).
